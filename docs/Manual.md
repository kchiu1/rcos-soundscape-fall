    - ```Current Location``` > ```Save as Marker```
    - ```Places Nearby``` > ```All Places/Public Transit``` > ```[choose a location]``` > ```Save as Marker```
      - You will be prompted to add a name and annotation (empty by default, doesn't need to have content). 
      - You can manually move the location by clicking the pencil and moving the location of the marker.
  - Markers can be viewed in ```Markers and Routes```, where it is the default tab that is open.

#### Route Waypoints
  - Route Waypoints are a set of marker that can be used as a route for you or someone else to navigate through.
  - To set a Route Waypoint:
    - ```Markers & Routes``` > ```Routes``` > ```+```
      - You will be prompted to set a name, description and to add waypoints, where you can add markers that you have saved to the route.
