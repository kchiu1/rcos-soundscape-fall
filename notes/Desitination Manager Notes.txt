Destination Manager

Audio beacon 15m cut-off #78
    - Idea: Try and make a new settings menu to manually change the button up to the user.
    - Location: apps\ios\GuideDogs\Code\Data\Destination Manager\DestinationManager.swift 
    - Settings Menu Location: apps\ios\GuideDogs\Code\Visual UI\View Controllers\Settings\SettingsViewController.swift

CLL location is from here.
    private struct BeaconArgs {
        let loc: CLLocation
        let heading: Heading
        var startMelody: Bool
        var endMelody: Bool
    }


static let LeaveImmediateVicinityDistance: CLLocationDistance = 30.0
static let EnterImmediateVicinityDistance: CLLocationDistance = 15.0 <- the key to fixing issue #78

To fix #78, we need to edit the static variables, which I am not sure how. It will not take it if its not static.
I tried a few things, but it hasn't really worked as of now. New menu setting still doesn't work.
