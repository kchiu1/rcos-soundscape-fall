what I did pre mid year commit summary

0. Look through the code
	run it on xcode simulator
	learn how swift works

1. set up ssh (don't really know how to use it)
	1.1 generate keys (dead end)
	1.1.1 ssh key-gen
	1.1.2 copypasting identical keys 
	ssh username@hostname

	1.2 Connect directly -> just needed the laptop password.

2. identify issue 
	78/40

3. Coding
	I didn't code since I was trying to set up ssh and it seems to be a dead end.

3.1 Forked repo (this is the only thing in it)

4. Future plans
	If i don't figure out ssh I will just take it and work on vscode and push to my fork
