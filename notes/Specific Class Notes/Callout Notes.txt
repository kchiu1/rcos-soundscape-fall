Callouts
The TTS feature of Soundscape.
Takes in data from the user -> converts it to a TTS
Uses GDLocalizedString.
Essentially, GDLocalizedString makes the TTS return a TTS of specified language.
This makes editing text really difficult and annoying because you would need to make TTS for every language, which is rough.

To remedy this, you could just make everything in english (yay america!)
But for this to work, anytime you want to add TTS (EG speed the user is going)
you need to add GDLocalizedString entries each time.

I made an attempt at editing the TTS but I couldn't figure out how to test moving on XCode.
If I had more time (E.G it was main semester, I would be able to maybe. I am still not fluent in swift)

I think GD stands for guide dogs lol
