Getting Help

To setup, first go to the docs folder.

In here, theres onboarding.md, overview.md, and a bunch of "useful" documents to help you get started
Realistically, only onboarding will help you though the installation process

It will tell you to install Microsoft azure, but none of us really did it or know what it does.

TLDR:
install XCode
install XCode commandline tools (i don't think you need this?)
Open GuideDogs.xcworkspace

Thats it LOL
You can do more but not sure what they do
